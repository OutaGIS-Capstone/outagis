## AWS Amplify React+Vite Starter Template

Primary repository to store all source code and related testing material, information, and documentation for the UBC 2024W Capstone project HA-30: OutaGIS

## Overview

This repository was created via a starter template for creating applications using React+Vite and AWS Amplify, emphasizing easy setup for authentication, API, and database capabilities. This template provides a foundational React application integrated with AWS Amplify, streamlined for scalability and performance. It is ideal for developers looking to jumpstart their project with pre-configured AWS services like Cognito, AppSync, and DynamoDB.

## Features

- **Authentication**: Setup with Amazon Cognito for secure user authentication.
- **API**: Ready-to-use GraphQL endpoint with AWS AppSync.
- **Database**: Real-time database powered by Amazon DynamoDB.

## Deploying to AWS

For detailed instructions on deploying your application, refer to the [deployment section](https://docs.amplify.aws/react/start/quickstart/#deploy-a-fullstack-app-to-aws) of our documentation.

URL of deployed app (as viewed on `main` branch): https://main.driio4xckehu.amplifyapp.com/

## Local Development (mostly for frontend)

Make sure `node.js` and `npm` are installed. There are many different ways to do this, but one simple tool is `nvm`, see the links for [Windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) and for [MacOS / Linux](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

In the root directory of this repo, run `npm install`. 

To relaunch the local dev server, run `npm run dev` (and Ctrl-C to terminate).
Navigate to the local link that appears in the terminal (i.e. `http://localhost:5173`).
